# NYU-Course-Schedule
 I am improving this repository.
 
 Hi, folksðŸ‘‹. Here is Hector He. I am currently a NYU graduate student major in computer EngineeringðŸ’». My interested field is applied machine learning.
 I am currently taking courses from NYU Tandon school of Engineering (ECE department) and NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences(Center for Data Science/ Computer Science).
 In this depository, I will proudly share you guys courses materials I took and open sources courses provided by NYU. Most of the courses is excellent and really worth learning.
 Besides, I `will` build the course map for NYU-CS/DS/ECE master program. 
 If you find this repo helpful for you, your ðŸŒŸ will be the best reward for me!
