 Hi, folksðŸ‘‹. Here is Hector He. I am currently a NYU graduate student major in computer EngineeringðŸ’». My interested field is applied machine learning and NLP.
 I am currently taking courses from NYU Tandon school of Engineering (ECE department) and NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences(Center for Data Science/ Computer Science).
